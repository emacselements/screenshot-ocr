# Screenshot OCR

A simple bash script that captures a screenshot of a selected screen region and extracts text from it using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

## Features

- üì∏ Interactive region selection for screenshots
- üîç Text extraction using Tesseract OCR
- üìã Automatic clipboard copying
- üìÑ Creates searchable OCR'd PDF of captured region
- üñ•Ô∏è Cross-platform compatibility (Linux/Unix systems)
- ‚ö° Lightweight and fast

## Dependencies

Before using this script, make sure you have the following tools installed:

### Required
- **maim**: Screenshot utility for region selection
- **tesseract**: OCR engine for text recognition

### Optional
- **xclip**: For copying recognized text to clipboard

## Installation

### Ubuntu/Debian
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install maim tesseract-ocr xclip
```

### Arch Linux
```bash
sudo pacman -S maim tesseract xclip
```

### Fedora/RHEL
```bash
sudo dnf install maim tesseract xclip
```

### macOS (using Homebrew)
```bash
brew install tesseract
# Note: maim is Linux-specific, consider using screencapture instead
```

## Usage

1. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x screenshot_ocr.sh
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./screenshot_ocr.sh
   ```

3. When prompted, click and drag to select the region of your screen containing the text you want to extract.

4. The script will:
   - Take a screenshot of the selected region
   - Process it with Tesseract OCR
   - Display the recognized text in the terminal
   - Copy the text to your clipboard (if xclip is available)
   - Create a searchable OCR'd PDF in `~/Desktop/ocr-screenshots/`

## How It Works

1. **Screenshot Capture**: Uses `maim -s` to allow interactive region selection
2. **OCR Processing**: Processes the screenshot with `tesseract` to extract text
3. **Output Display**: Shows the recognized text in the terminal
4. **Clipboard Integration**: Automatically copies the text to clipboard using `xclip`
5. **PDF Creation**: Generates a searchable PDF with embedded OCR text layer

## File Locations

Temporary files (automatically cleaned up):
- Screenshot: `/tmp/screenshot.png`
- OCR output: `/tmp/recognized_text.txt`

Output files:
- OCR'd PDFs: `~/Desktop/ocr-screenshots/screenshot_ocr_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.pdf`

## Troubleshooting

### Screenshot fails
- Ensure `maim` is installed and accessible
- Check that you have permission to write to `/tmp/`

### OCR produces poor results
- Ensure the selected region has clear, readable text
- Consider adjusting the image quality or size
- Install additional Tesseract language packs if needed:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install tesseract-ocr-[language-code]
  ```

### Text not copied to clipboard
- Install `xclip`: `sudo apt install xclip`
- Ensure you're running in a graphical environment with clipboard support

### PDF creation fails
- Ensure Tesseract is installed with PDF support (most modern versions include this)
- Check that you have write permissions to `~/Desktop/ocr-screenshots/`
- Verify the directory exists (the script creates it automatically)

## Customization

You can modify the script to:
- Change temporary file locations
- Change PDF output directory (default: `~/Desktop/ocr-screenshots/`)
- Add different OCR languages
- Adjust Tesseract parameters for better accuracy
- Add support for different clipboard managers
